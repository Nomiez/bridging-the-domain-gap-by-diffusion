# Convert Depth Format

"The convert-depth-format module provides two functionalities. The first one inverts the depth map 
(Sythehicle provides depth information with the nearest objects being the darkest, while the depth control net 
requires the reverse), and the second one includes a denormalizer that allows a function to run on each pixel of a 
depth map, reverting possible normalizations." ~Thesis

## Installation
This module can be used out of the box.
