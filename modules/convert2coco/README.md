# Convert to COCO

"As the package name already states, this module converts an input stream into the COCO format, exporting the label 
files as JSON. With the help of the `split()` method [...] and some prepossessing functions, the input stream can be 
split to allow the dataset to contain the train, test, and validation labels. The purpose of this module is primarily 
to help with the evaluation through the YoloX module." ~Thesis
