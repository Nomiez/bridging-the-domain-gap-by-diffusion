\chapter*{Abstract}

This thesis addresses the growing need for realistic synthetic data in computer vision, particularly for object detection and tracking tasks, where real data is expensive and/or difficult to obtain. With the upcoming possibilities of advanced latent diffusion models, such as the open model Stable Diffusion by StabilityAI \cite{esser2024scalingrectifiedflowtransformers}, new opportunities have emerged to enhance synthetic datasets, making them more realistic while retaining advantages like easy semantic labeling of synthetic data generation.

The main contribution of this work is the development of an easy-to-extend pipeline leveraging the "Adversarial Supervision Makes Layout-to-Image Diffusion" (ALDM) \cite{li2024aldm} to transform existing synthetic images via its semantic segmentation labels into  realistic and high-variance datasets. For postprocessing, this pipeline uses image-to-image processing guided by semantic segmentation labels and depth ground truth to generate images in varied weather, lighting, and scene conditions \cite{rombach2022highresolution} \cite{zhang2023addingconditionalcontroltexttoimage}. The pipeline's effectiveness was evaluated through different experiments, particularly focusing on video analysis tasks like object detection and tracking.

Results indicate that while ALDM and its post-processing techniques are promising, challenges such as object distortion and noise amplification persist, limiting the overall accuracy of the generated data. Nevertheless, ALDM demonstrates robust spatial-temporal consistency on fixed camera scenes, particularly in maintaining background stability. These findings highlight the potential of diffusion-based synthetic data generation, underlining the need for further research focussing on image output with more training and integrating segmentation and depth information to enhance the resulting dataset quality.
